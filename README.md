> Final Project for 2018 Developer Program by ConsenSys Academy

This is the final project of Online Marketplace on Ethereum network by KK Chen, kk@bichenkk.com.

Demo https://ethstore.binatir.com/ on Rinkeby Testnet

## What does this project do?

This is a marketplace running on Ethereum network.
Creator of this contract will become the administrator of the marketplace. He can add addresses into EthStore to allow them become store owners and create online stores with ether payment.
Store owners can list products. When there is someone purchased the product, the payment will be sent to the EthStore contract and store owner can withdraw.

  Administrator can
  * create store for addresses
  * enable / disable store

  Store owners can
  * edit store information
  * add products
  * edit product information

  Everyone can
  * purchase products
  * withdraw their own balances on contract
  * view transactions

## How to set it up on local development server?

Make sure you have installed
* node.js v8.11.4 (The latest LTS)
* git
* yarn
* MetaMask

Follow the steps:

1. Install Truffle and Ganache CLI globally. Truffle is the smart contract development framework for Ethereum and Ganache is the personal blockchain running locally for development.
    ```javascript
    // Install Truffle and Ganache globally
    npm install -g truffle ganache-cli
    ```

2. Run the development blockchain with 2-second blocktime. Keep Ganache running on this Terminal shell.
    ```javascript
    // Run Ganache locally with network-id 5001 and 2-second blocktime on port 8545
    ganache-cli -b 2 -p 8545 -i 5001
    ```
   Copy the first private key (0) generated by Ganache.
    ```javascript
    // Copy the first private key
    Private Keys
    ======================
    (0) Your First Private Key
    ```


3. Open MetaMask on Chrome. Choose network Localhost 8545 and import account with private key copied from Ganache.
> Reminder: Do Not Choose MetaMask Beta

4. Open another window of Terminal. Download and kickstart EthStore.
    ```javascript
    // Download from Github
    git clone git@github.com:bichenkk/ethstore.git
    // Kickstart EthStore
    cd ethstore
    npm run kickstart
    ```

    The npm script `kickstart` will do the followings
    * install npm packages
    * remove truffle build files
    * compile and migrate contracts on local development network (port:8545)
    * start webpack and open EthStore React.js app on http://localhost:3000

5. You should be able to see the EthStore dapp. You can make purchases and switch accounts to try different roles. Have fun!

If you have restarted the ganache again, you may face the problem of `TX doesn't have the correct nonce.`. You need to start your ganache everytime with a new network id so the MetaMask can recognise it is a new chain.
```javascript
// Run Ganache with a new network id
ganache-cli -b 2 -p 8545 -i [new-network-id]
```

## Test for EthStore contract

You can start running test with truffle. It tries to cover most core functions in the EthStore contract.

```javascript
// Inside ethstore
// Start running test on local Ganache with port 8545
truffle test
```

The tests checks three main sections
* EthStore / EthStoreSample / EthStoreBase
* EthStoreAdministrator
* EthStoreStoreOwner

The tests basically checks if
* the creator of the contract has the administrator right
* only administrator can create stores for addresses
* only store owners can edit their own stores
* administrator can disable stores
* users can make a purchase
* users can withdraw payment if they have balances
* store owners can edit their product
* administrator can disable products
* users have the correct identities
* the emergency stop stops purchases and withdrawals
* only administrator can stop the contract
